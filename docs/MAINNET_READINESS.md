# AgentVouch Mainnet Readiness

`v0.2.0` is a USDC-native devnet release. It is not mainnet-ready until the items below are complete and reviewed.

## Required Decisions

- Final mainnet values for `author_proceeds_lock_seconds`, `refund_claim_window_seconds`, `challenger_reward_bps`, and `challenger_reward_cap_usdc_micros`.
- Whether upgrade authority remains active, moves behind a timelock, or is frozen after hardening.
- Which multisig or governance mechanism controls upgrade, config, treasury, and settlement authorities.
- Which monitoring and incident channels are authoritative.

## Authority Policy

Mainnet must not depend on a single hot wallet for:

- program upgrades
- config changes
- treasury movement
- x402 settlement authority
- dispute resolver authority
- pause or emergency controls, when implemented

Before mainnet:

1. Put critical authorities behind multisig or stronger governance.
2. Document signer set, threshold, rotation procedure, and emergency removal procedure.
3. Record authority pubkeys in the production runbook.
4. Test authority rotation on devnet.

## Treasury Policy

Document:

- treasury vault addresses
- withdrawal authority
- approval threshold
- accounting cadence
- public reporting expectations
- reserve and sweep rules for unclaimed refund funds

Treasury movement should be explainable from on-chain events and operator notes.

## Monitoring

Monitor at least:

- program upgrade authority changes
- config authority changes
- `ReputationConfig` changes
- protocol treasury vault balance
- x402 settlement vault balance
- listing reward vault balances
- purchase, vouch, author bond, dispute, and claim events
- indexing lag between Solana and API responses
- failed purchase verification or raw download authorization
- unexpected treasury or settlement movement

## Incident Response

Have playbooks for:

- bad config
- stuck settlement vault funds
- compromised authority
- failed indexer or stale API data
- erroneous dispute resolution
- bad IDL/client deploy
- Neon branch mismatch
- Solana RPC outage or cluster mismatch

Each playbook should include:

- detection signal
- severity
- owner
- immediate stop action
- rollback path
- public/user communication threshold
- postmortem requirements

## Security Review

Before mainnet, complete an external or senior internal review of:

- every USDC-moving instruction
- token account owner and mint constraints
- PDA vault ownership and authority seeds
- arithmetic overflow and underflow behavior
- active-dispute freezes and slashing paths
- voucher reward math
- x402 settlement memo binding and payment-ref uniqueness
- authority rotation and rollback paths

## Launch Checklist

- `NO_DNA=1 anchor build` passes.
- Full Anchor test suite passes.
- Web and CLI tests pass.
- `npm run build --workspace @agentvouch/web` passes.
- IDL and generated clients are synced.
- `web/public/skill.md`, docs, CLI, Vercel env, and public app all reference the same program/config.
- Production runbook has current authority pubkeys, env matrix, smoke checks, and rollback steps.
- SEO and LLM-facing docs are handled in Milestone 14; pitch deck alignment is handled in Milestone 15 after settlement behavior is reflected.
